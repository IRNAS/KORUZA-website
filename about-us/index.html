					<p>We at <a href="http://irnas.eu/" target="_blank" alt="IRNAS" name="IRNAS">Institute IRNAS Raƒçe</a> strive to apply the vast scientific knowledge to everyday reality by creating effective and affordable systems, as we believe in an open-source world and sharing. With the KORUZA project we aim to empower the world with a new free-space communication system that enables everyone without specialised knowledge to set up ultra-fast connections at a relatively low cost.</p>
