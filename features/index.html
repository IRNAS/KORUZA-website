		                <p>KORUZA is developed to be an open-source open-hardware networking technology for deployment in all situations - from home networks, community wireless networks to service providers. It is primarily designed for urban environments, where Wi-Fi networks suffer from RF spectrum congestion and deploying wired is extremely expensive. KORUZA is resilient to these problems as its light beam is highly collimated, thus numerous units can coexist in a dense urban area, where the demand for capacity is high and distances are relatively short. The development aims for the system to be fully 3D printable and suitable for DIY construction, resulting in a small and simple unit that can be mounted on a wall, window shelf or a pole, even by untrained professionals without specialized tools. Home users can simply establish the connection with a neighbour who has fibre broadband. Community wireless networks can use the system to boost their wireless backbone capacity. Internet service providers can employ it for last-mile access and inter-user connectivity. Researchers exploit the open nature of the system to modify it for their own experiments.</p>

		                <p>The design exploits the bi-directional optical path via a single plano-convex lens, as SFP Bi-Di modules inherently have coaxial receiving and transmitting optical axes for aiming the collimated beam at a distant complementary pair, that places the focal point of the received beam sufficiently in the SFP module focal point. The infra-red collimated beam is experimentally aligned with manual theta-phi stage to be parallel with the green auxiliary laser beam, that is used as a visual aid for initial coarse manual alignment. By exploiting the SFP module digital monitoring mode, the received IR optical power is monitored by the control system, establishing the IR beam lock-in condition after initial manual aiming using the green aiming laser. Based on the real-time received optical power, the units are precisely aligned with motorized X and Y micrometer stages to maximize the optical power.</p>
		                <p>Mechanical construction of the system is designed to be fully 3D printable to enable easy modification and experimentation, as well as to decrease the system cost. An innovative approach combining precision screws and low-cost stepper motors enables micrometer precision alignment in X and Y axis translating to angular displacement of the inner movable arm with pivot mounting in front. F axis linear translation of the SFP module inside the inner structure adjusts the collimation of the laser beam. The outer enclosure is designed to be cut from stock aluminium elements and acts as a manual coarse alignment stage, to align the units within the motorized movement range.</p>
		                <p>Control electronics system connects to the SFP module via the digital diagnostic interface collecting temperature, Transmitter/Reciever (TX/RX) power measurement, interfacing stepper modules as well as a range of sensors for environmental sensing.</p><p>Environmental sensor range is deployed to observe and measure a number of parameters that could potentially affect system performance and are particularly useful for debugging and research purposes. This includes sensors for detecting mechanical disturbances and movement as well as meteorological sensors for observing the micro-climate.</p><p>A Wi-Fi router running an open source OpenWRT firmware is used to collect and store the measurements, generate traffic for packer error rate monitoring and send data real-time to a monitoring system.</p>
