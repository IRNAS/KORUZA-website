			                <p>World Wide KORUZA experiment is the worlds first free-space optical coordinated experiment, deploying KORUZA at various locations around the globe for 6-12 months to evaluate the communication channel as well as the system performance, creating the first open data set on performance of a FSO system and the communication channel. We are inviting community networks and research institutions to participate in the experiment and sponsor deployments.</p>

			                <p>Experimental evaluation of FSO systems is traditionally associated with high costs and design complexity due to the high complexity of currently available systems and their significantly integrated nature. Often this prohibits researchers to modify systems and test their work, requiring them to construct their own systems. KORUZA as an open-source system mitigates these problems, the design transparency enables simple modification and adaptation to for a range of purposes. A local performance baseline is created over the period of 6-12 months, later enabling researchers to later modify the devices, improve them with their own transceivers, apply control and auto-tracking algorithms or modify otherwise and compare results to the baseline.</p>

			                <p>For community networks, KORUZA offers an alternative to often congested RF spectrum, ready to be tested. We are inviting networks to deploy the experimental links in their networks, pass real data through it however still keep the current RF links for the experimental duration as the fall-over option. The information gathered and findings from this experiment will feed back to the design and enable everyone to construct units on their own at a later time, deploying them in the network.

			                <p>Leading motivation for launching the experiment is properly testing KORUZA system in real-world scenarios over a longer period of time, making it ready for an open-source release and creating an open data-set on FSO channel behaviour at a large number of locations. Additionally we want to establish a testbed and development basis for the FSO research.</p><p>KORUZA experiment consists of two devices, one at either side of the link between buildings or structures 50-150m apart with a clear line of sight. Every device is extended with test equipment and sensors to evaluate the performance, link properties as well as observing environmental parameters. Measurements are collected at the rate of 1Hz, except the optical received power at the rate of 10Hz, made available in real time through nodewatcher platform. Test units are a part of the Wlan Slovenija community network, using the VPN service to connect to the server and establishing a data collection link.</p>
			                <p>Every communication unit is equipped with the range of sensors to monitor the following parameters:</p>
		                	<ul>
		                		<li>optical communication module (Temperature, Voltage, TX power, TX current, RX power, Link LOS state)</li>
		                		<li>structure monitoring (Temperature 3D printed structure, Temperature enclosure, accelerometer)</li>
		                		<li>control system and environment (Voltage, Ambient light, Temperature)</li>
		                	</ul>
			                <p>The test device is deployed next to ever unit to generate traffic and test for packet loss, aggregate all measurement and connect to the internet. It consists of:</p>
		                	<ul>
		                		<li>openwrt capable 1Gbps router (WR1043 v2, WDR4300...)</li>
		                		<li>USB webcam C270 (one side of the link)</li>
		                		<li>USB link to KORUZA</li>
		                		<li>USB weather station WH1080 (only on one side of the link, Temperature, Relative humidity, Rain, Wind speed and direction)</li>
