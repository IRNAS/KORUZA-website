                            <p>Experimental evaluation of FSO systems is traditionally associated with high costs and design complexity due to the high complexity of currently available systems and their significantly integrated nature. Often this prohibits researchers to modify systems and test their work, requiring them to construct their own systems. KORUZA as an open-source system mitigates these problems, the design transparency enables simple modification and adaptation for a range of purposes. A local performance baseline is created over the period of 6-12 months, enabling researchers to later modify the devices, improve them with their own transceivers, apply control and auto-tracking algorithms or modify otherwise and compare results to the baseline.</p>

We are inviting networks to deploy the experimental links in their networks, pass real data through it however still keep the current RF links for the experimental duration as the fall-over option. The information gathered and findings from this experiment will feed back to the design and enable everyone to construct units on their own at a later time, deploying them in the network.

                            <p>Leading motivation for launching the experiment is properly testing KORUZA system in real-world scenarios over a longer period of time, making it ready for an open-source release and creating an open data-set on FSO channel behaviour at a large number of locations. Additionally we want to establish a testbed and development basis for the FSO research.</p><p>KORUZA experiment consists of two devices, one at either side of the link between buildings or structures 50-150m apart with a clear line of sight. Every device is extended with test equipment and sensors to evaluate the performance, link properties as well as observing environmental parameters. Measurements are collected at the rate of 1Hz, except the optical received power at the rate of 10Hz, made available in real time through nodewatcher platform. Test units are a part of the Wlan Slovenija community network, using the VPN service to connect to the server and establishing a data collection link.</p>
                            <p>Every communication unit is equipped with the range of sensors to monitor the following parameters:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>optical communication module (Temperature, Voltage, TX power, TX current, RX power, Link LOS state)</li>

                        Knowing characteristics of a laser beam, i.e. its spatial energy distribution, is essential for most wireless optical applications. The beam profile is used to characterize the
                        quality of optical sources, observe effects introduced by lenses and other optical components. Utilising NIR pixel sensor unit coupled to a low-cost and open-source CNC machine movement
                        system, an alternative beam scanner system was designed, suitable for producing a 2D scan of
                        emitted optical power at a fixed distance from the source. Multiple 2D scans, taken at varies
                        distances from the optical source are used to create a volumetric model of power distribution of an
                        optical beam.

                        For terrestrial FSO systems, primarily located in urban areas offering mid-range connections, the leading cause of attenuation is presence of aerosols such as fog, smoke or dust in the
                        atmosphere, due to scattering and absorption of the optical beam. Fog is composed of dispersed
                        water droplets, generally between 10-15 microns in diameter, which is close to the near IR spectrum,
                        thus Mie scattering, which appears when particles present in the atmosphere and the wavelength
                        are comparable in size is present. In an indoor experiment, closely mimicking ambient conditions in the case of fog, smoke or
                        both, outdoor conditions are simulated in a controlled manner, using fog machine, dry ice and a
                        signal  are. Controlled conditions allow performance of reliable measurements, otherwise often not
                        possible due to irregularity and inhomogeneous distribution of the natural fog.

                        Uneven exposure to the Sun and sudden or gradual variation of the
                        temperature of either surrounding atmosphere, mount or enclosure can lead to gradual degradation
                        of the link or even complete loss due to physical deformation of components and consequential
                        misalignment.
                        Depending on the material used, daily and seasonal temperature variations can result in thermal
                        expansion which causes periodical misalignment of the link. Data analysis of current link deployments suggest strong correlation between day-to-night temperature variation and link availability,
                        however exact cause of link degradation remains unknown. Artifcial variation of the temperature

                        affected and find potential cause of impairment.

                        Another phenomenon potentially contributing to link loss is scintillation - optical
                        turbulence resulting from small temperature variations along the link path. Inhomogeneous temperature distribution of the atmosphere causes varying refractive index along the link and thus
                        scattering of the beam at different angles. Consequentially 
                        fluctuations in received power due to
                        redistribution of intensity within the beam may appear. Although the research indicates scintillation is not a mayor concern for optical links shorter than 500m, variance of the optical power
                        can be compared for the monitored link inside test facility and outside link of same length, as the
                        scintillation in closed dark space should be minimal.

                        degradation of the signal. In contrast to changes in the atmosphere, loss is contributed to the
                        temporal or prolonged misalignment of two units and not scattering of the beam. As units are
                        usually mounted on a building, either rooftop or wall, building vibrations can have significant
                        impact on the link performance, specially in urban environment due to motorways, public transport
                        such as under and overground railways, construction work and also mechanical equipment present
                        in the building itself.
                        Another problem may arise due to wind induced movement of buildings, railings and unit itself,
                        potentially problematic in mounting on tall structures.
