					KORUZA is developed to be an open-source open-hardware networking technology for deployment in all situations - from home networks, community wireless networks to service providers. It is primarily designed for urban environments, where Wi-Fi networks suffer from RF spectrum congestion and deploying wired is extremely expensive. KORUZA is resilient to these problems as its light beam is highly collimated, thus numerous units can coexist in a dense urban area, where the demand for capacity is high and distances are relatively short. The development aims for the system to be fully 3D printable and suitable for DIY construction, resulting in a small and simple unit that can be mounted on a wall, window shelf or a pole, even by untrained professionals without specialized tools.

			                <p>Experimental evaluation of FSO systems is traditionally associated with high costs and design complexity due to the high complexity of currently available systems and their significantly integrated nature. Often this prohibits researchers to modify systems and test their work, requiring them to construct their own systems. KORUZA as an open-source system mitigates these problems, the design transparency enables simple modification and adaptation for a range of purposes. A local performance baseline is created over the period of 6-12 months, enabling researchers to later modify the devices, improve them with their own transceivers, apply control and auto-tracking algorithms or modify otherwise and compare results to the baseline.</p>

The information gathered and findings from this experiment will feed back to the design and enable everyone to construct units on their own at a later time, deploying them in the network.

			                <p>Leading motivation for launching the experiment is properly testing KORUZA system in real-world scenarios over a longer period of time, making it ready for an open-source release and creating an open data-set on FSO channel behaviour at a large number of locations. Additionally we want to establish a testbed and development basis for the FSO research.</p><p>KORUZA experiment consists of two devices, one at either side of the link between buildings or structures 50-150m apart with a clear line of sight. Every device is extended with test equipment and sensors to evaluate the performance, link properties as well as observing environmental parameters. Measurements are collected at the rate of 1Hz, except the optical received power at the rate of 10Hz, made available in real time through nodewatcher platform. Test units are a part of the Wlan Slovenija community network, using the VPN service to connect to the server and establishing a data collection link.</p>
			                <p>Every communication unit is equipped with the range of sensors to monitor the following parameters:</p>
